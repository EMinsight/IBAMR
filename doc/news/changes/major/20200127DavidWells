New: Added a new class IBTK::MergingLoadBalancer, which is a SAMRAI load
balancer that combines common boxes on each processor. This improves performance
with IBFEMethod by lowering the total number of boxes, which lowers the total
number of ghost cells, which lowers the total number of elements over which we
must iterate for force spreading and velocity interpolation.
