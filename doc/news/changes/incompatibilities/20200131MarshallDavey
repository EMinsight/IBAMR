Incompatibility: The functions registerGhostfillRefineAlgorithm, registerProlongRefineAlgoritm, and registerCoarsenAlgorithm 
of the HierarchyIntegrator class have been edited to accept std::unique_ptr<RefinePatchStrategy<NDIM> >, 
std::unique_ptr<RefinePatchStrategy<NDIM> >, and std::unique_ptr<CoarsenPatchStrategy<NDIM> > respectively. This is an update 
from the functions previously accepting RefinePatchStrategy<NDIM>*, RefinePatchStrategy<NDIM>*, and CoarsenPatchStrategy<NDIM>* 
respectively. This change was made to clarify that the HierarchyIntegrator class is ultimately responsible for destruction of 
ghostfill_patch_strategy, prolong_patch_strategy, and coarsen_patch_strategy respectively. The function calls have been updated
for the IBStrategy and IBHierarchyIntegrator classes as well to reflect these changes.
